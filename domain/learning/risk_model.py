"""Self-improving write-risk model: learns what memory poisoning looks like *for this deployment*.

Regex rules catch textbook injections and miss everything else, and they flag benign
instructions ("when asked about status, reply with the ticket link") forever. Here every
reviewer decision is a label:

    quarantine_rejected  -> malicious (1)
    quarantine_released  -> benign    (0)
    confirmed            -> benign    (0)

A hashed word n-gram logistic regression is trained online (AdaGrad, L2) from those labels.
It is seeded with a small built-in corpus so it is useful on day one. Then:

  * Threshold depends on trust. Low-trust sources need less evidence to be held; a user's own
    words need a lot (``base + slope * trust``).
  * The threshold tunes itself from reviewer precision. If reviewers keep releasing what the model
    held (false positives cost reviewer time), it rises; if they keep rejecting, it falls.
  * Every score is explainable: the n-grams that pushed it up are returned with the quarantine.

Pure Python with no external ML dependency, deterministic, and inexpensive enough to run on every write.

Privacy: features are hashed with a per-tenant secret (keyed BLAKE2b), and training events store only
feature indices, never text. The durable event log therefore cannot be dictionary-reversed into the
content of erased memories. Explanations are computed from the text being scored, and the "top risk
features" report only names tokens from the built-in seed corpus.
